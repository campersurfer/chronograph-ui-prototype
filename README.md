# Chronograph UI Prototype

Lightweight UI prototype for the Chronograph health tracking app. Built for rapid prototyping and testing with AI-powered design tools like Bolt.new, v0, and others.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This prototype allows you to:
- **Clone and test UI designs** from health apps you admire
- **Iterate quickly** on design concepts
- **Test user flows** for onboarding and core features
- **Demo concepts** to stakeholders
- **Import into AI tools** for further enhancement

## ðŸš€ Features

### Core Screens
- **Onboarding Flow**: 3-step user setup with goals and sensitivities
- **Dashboard**: Health metrics overview with quick actions
- **Food Logging**: Intuitive food tracking with photo/barcode options
- **Mood Tracking**: Comprehensive mood and symptom tracking
- **Food-Mood Insights**: Data visualization and pattern discovery

### Design System
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Health-focused color palette** (wellness, mood, energy themes)
- **Modern UI patterns** inspired by leading health apps

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Using with AI Design Tools

### Bolt.new
1. Upload this entire folder to Bolt.new
2. Modify screens with prompts like:
   - "Make the food logging more like MyFitnessPal"
   - "Add a barcode scanner interface"
   - "Create a progress tracking screen"

### v0 by Vercel
1. Copy individual screen components
2. Use prompts to enhance:
   - "Improve the onboarding UX"
   - "Add animations to the mood tracker"

### Claude Artifacts
1. Copy screen code for individual testing
2. Test specific interactions and flows

## ðŸ“± Key Health App Patterns

### Onboarding
- Goal selection with visual icons
- Progressive disclosure (3 steps)
- Sensitivity mapping for personalization

### Food Logging
- Multiple input methods (search, photo, barcode)
- Quick-add favorites
- Meal type categorization
- Real-time calorie tracking

### Mood Tracking
- Visual mood scale (1-10 with emojis)
- Multi-dimensional tracking (emotions, energy, symptoms)
- Note-taking for context

### Insights
- Data visualization
- Pattern recognition
- Actionable recommendations
- Progress over time

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for Prototyping

- **Small codebase** (~50KB) - works with all AI tools
- **Self-contained** - no external dependencies beyond React
- **Mobile-optimized** - test on real devices instantly
- **Extensible** - easy to add new screens and features
- **Modern stack** - Vite + React + Tailwind for fast iteration

## ðŸ”„ Iteration Workflow

1. **Test current design** - Run locally and test on devices
2. **Identify improvements** - Note UX issues or missing features  
3. **Use AI tools** - Upload to Bolt.new/v0 for enhancements
4. **Deploy and test** - Get live URL for stakeholder feedback
5. **Repeat** - Iterate based on feedback

This prototype bridges the gap between design ideas and working software, perfect for solo developers who want to move fast without getting bogged down in complex design tools.

## ðŸŒŸ Next Steps

Once you've perfected the UI/UX in this prototype, you can:
- Copy designs back to the main Chronograph React Native app
- Use as a reference for developer implementation
- Continue using for ongoing feature prototyping

Ready to revolutionize health tracking! ðŸš€
